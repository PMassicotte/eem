## Comment

 - This is a re-submission from 2017-05-05. CRAN URL and a better Description Field has been provided.
 - There was 1 note regarding changing email address. The issue is that I can't use my old email anymore (pm@bios.au.dk). This was my Aarhus University email when I did my postdoc. When I left after the postdoc, the email as been canceled. I will now use my generic hotmail address (pmassicotte@hotmail.com). I have two other CRAN packages (cdom and gtrendsR) With Dirk Eddelbuettel. He can confirm my identity if needed. Thank you.
